New in 3.3: added eVC++ support (H/PC pro, PsPC 1.2, Pocket PC). Removed C2084 error when used in an MFC application. Changes in the library are listed at http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl.

Usage: Decompress the archive to a directory of your choice. From eVC++, add the directory name to the include search path (Tools/Options.../Directories). Note that you must repeat this step for all desired "CPUs" / "Platform" combinations.
